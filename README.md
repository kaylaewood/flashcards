## The Project
The FlashCards game is a game playable through the Command Line Interface. I was given a starter pack with a few files to begin. This game was created using OOP in JavaScript.

## How To Play
1. Clone this repo.
2. Inside that directory, type `node index.js` in your terminal.
3. Select your answers by typing the number OR by using your arrow and return keys.
4. Enjoy!
